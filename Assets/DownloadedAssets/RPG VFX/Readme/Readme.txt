Documentation of RPG Pack
In this document we will cover the workflow of RPG Effects. We have created different RPG effects and 
all the effects can be modified easily because each effect has multiple child and each child has its own 
unique texture if you want to create a new effect so you have to update textures which you want and 
can change the colors. In this pack we have created different circles effect, trails effect, spark effects, 
and glow effects etc. By using unique textures of sci-fi circle and all other textures which we used for 
trails, spark and glow effects.
RPG Pack consists of 12 different visual effects which are created individually, so you can use them to 
create an intuitive and eye-catching user interface for your 3D game and animated environment. These 
visual effects can be edited and placed at any scene in the 3D environment to give it more defined look.
